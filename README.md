# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This program serves as a guide for what I've learnt in the Prework Study Work.
By building this project, I had an opportunity to practice HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and GIT while also making a list and guide of such knowledge.
It helps to guide students who just started the bootcamp.
